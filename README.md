# From-Theory-to-Implementation-An-Application-of-Graph-Algorithms-to-Map-Construction-Traversal

This project explores the practical application of graph algorithms in constructing and traversing maps, drawing inspiration from visually appealing tools like Google Maps. By evaluating traversal costs through directed links representing distance, the project considers topological, environmental, and human-centric factors.

# Key Features
Graph Construction: Utilizes algorithms such as Prim's and Kruskal's for constructing Minimum Spanning Trees (MST), enabling efficient map creation.
Traversal Algorithms: Implements BFS, Dijkstra's, and Bellman-Ford algorithms to evaluate and optimize traversal costs, ensuring effective pathfinding and navigation.
Optimal Data Structures: Employs priority queues and binary trees to enhance performance and adaptability to real-world scenarios.
Real-World Relevance: Demonstrates the application of graph theory to real-world problems, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the project, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing these graph algorithms for map construction and traversal.
